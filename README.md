Programming submission for rtCamp Assessment - Senior WordPress Engineer.

## WordPress Plugin Challenge

There are already more than 10000 WordPress plugins out there. So itâ€™s really hard to set up a challenge for you! Still, we need to create a playground for you. So we came up with a few ideas for the plugin. Go ahead with anyone below:

### Challenge-1: WordPress-Slideshow Plugin

This plugin will test if you are familiar with WordPress shortcodes.

#### Admin-Side:

- Create an admin-side settings page.
- Provide an interface to add/remove images from plugin settings page.
- User must be able to change order of uploaded image. (Hint: Use http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#connect-lists )

#### Front-end:

- Create provision for a shortcode like [myslideshow]
- When you add shortcode [myslideshow] to any page, it will be replaced by a slideshow of images uploaded from admin-side.
- You can use any jQuery slideshow library/plugin.
